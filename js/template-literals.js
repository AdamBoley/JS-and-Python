let fullName = "Bilbo Baggins";
let home = "Bag End";

console.log(`${fullName} lives at ${home}`);

//This is a template literal, used for calling variables in a string
//Note the tilde or backtick marks used here
//The output in the console is "Bilbo Baggins lives at Bag End", since the string is calling the two variables
